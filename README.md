# BayesianInt: Explore Bayes factors in Testing Interactions

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/BayesianInt](https://shinyappstore.com/a/BayesianInt)__

BayesianInt is a valuable application designed to aid users in exploring Bayes factors specifically for testing interactions in statistical analysis. The tool can calculate Bayes factors for both 2x2 between-groups and within-participants designs. It introduces a rule of thumb to estimate the required sample size for a well-powered clinical study design. Bayes factors play a crucial role in statistical analysis, particularly for psychologists investigating whether an experimental manipulation has different effects in various conditions. BayesianInt demonstrates through a case study that neglecting the test of interaction can lead to unjustified conclusions and emphasizes the principle that any assertion about interaction necessitates a direct comparison of conditions. It serves as an educational resource to prevent misinterpretations in statistical analyses, promoting a more accurate and nuanced understanding of experimental outcomes.
